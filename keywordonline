## CURATORIAL STATEMENT

In higher education, the term “online” has become synonymous eLearning-style training and MOOCs. This narrow view of online, with a focus on content delivery and automated assessment, is spread via mainstream media, as in this recent quote from Inside Higher Ed: “Online education can offer personalized pathways through course content with short lecture videos and well-time quizzes that help students retain knowledge…” This perspective values online learning for its efficiency, flexibility, and convenience, claiming the appeal of “anytime, anywhere” education (Richardson & Swan 69). It has also marginalized online learning and de-emphasized the characteristics of that make it distinctive and exciting as a model of education (Pacansky-Brock). It’s no surprise when pundits and educators alike argue that online learning can never match the quality of face-to-face or even blended learning because, as Ian Lamont argues, “there [i]s almost no meaningful student/teacher or student/student interaction. To equate this type of online learning with a real-world classroom experience is a major stretch.”

To be fair, much online learning treats online spaces as containers, especially where institutions have adopted self-paced or templated models. However, many educators reject this view and instead focus on how online can transform education and provide new reflections on what it means to be and learn online. 

This collection of resources is shaped by the educators who have embraced online learning beyond content. These resources, and the educators behind them, elevate new ways of thinking about online-ness and ask students to participate fully and critically in the online experience. They encompass some of the digital literacies considered essential for today’s teachers and learners. Artifacts in this collection are divided into three focus areas: authorship, community/networked participation, and presence/embodiment. Though treated separately, some examples demonstrate the ways in which all three can be addressed in meaningful learning contexts.

__Authorship__
Online authorship is not just writing in online spaces. Implicit in the notion of authorship are the “language, methodology, and training” (Rheingold 31) teachers and learners need to no longer consume what is online, but to author it. Too many technologies and models of online learning relegate the learner to a consumer role and give authorship rights only to the instructor (or sometimes, only to the designer of an online course). Examples in this section push back a plug-and-play view of online spaces and embrace the uncertainty and complexities of digital authorship, including questions raised by “public” authorship, sharing, and remixing.

__Community and networked participation__
Perhaps the greatest, and often unrealized, opportunity for meaningful online learning is through connections to people and networks within and outside of a class. Students work in online “walled gardens,” such as Learning Management Systems, and are not encouraged to venture beyond those digital walls to connect to people and networks. Yet those unwalled connections are Gardner Campbell argued, “we must add digitally mediated networked learning to Kuh's [high impact practices] list, because the experience of building and participating within a digitally mediated network of discovery and collaboration is an increasingly necessary foundation for all other forms of experiential learning in a digital age. Moreover, the experience of building and participating within a digitally mediated network of discovery is itself a form of experiential learning…” Resources in this collection provide examples for intentional building and fostering of networks and communities as part of online learning.

__Presence/Embodiment__
The third area this collection investigates is presence and embodiment. Siân Bayne (105) says, “The distanced, unstable relationship between body and subject with which we engage when we communicate online involves us in modes of identity formation and pedagogical relations which are very different from those which, as learners and teachers, we experience in the face to face classroom.”  The lack of physical embodiment and co-presence may be most detrimental to online learners, as those can contribute to feelings that online learning lacks authenticity or veracity (Land 531). Land noted, “The notion that the visibility of the learner or teacher serves as an anchor of truthfulness or veracity (‘you can look your interlocutor in the eye’) might lead one to conclude that authenticity is dependent upon physical embodiment. It would follow from this line of reasoning, that lack of embodiment renders the cyber space, which is unquestionably a simulated environment, a ‘false’ environment.” 

As expected, questions of embodiment and presence pervade the literature on online learning, highlighting their importance. The disembodied or absent online learner is characterized as a “lurker” and strategies for dealing with lurkers often devolve to compliance (number of logins, number of discussion posts, etc.). Research points to the importance of establishing social, cognitive, and teaching presence in online learning experiences, the integration of which is said to foster a Community of Inquiry (Garrison) among teachers and learners. Examples in this section explore or reimagine presence and provide a sense of eventness for online learning experiences.

### Presence

* Annotation Flash Mob
* Artifact type: Blog post with links to assignment details
* Screenshot: Online-blogpost-annotationflashmob.png
* Source URL: https://gamesandlearning.wordpress.com/2016/04/27/about-that-annotation-flash-mob/
* Artifact permissions: Unclear, but assignment details are publicly available
* Creator and Affiliation: Remi Holden / CU Denver
* Annotation: Inspired by Sean Michael Morris' [Teaching in our right minds: Critical Digital Pedagogy and the Response to the New](http://www.digitalpedagogylab.com/hybridped/teaching-in-our-right-minds/) Remi Holden organized an annotation flash mob in his course, where his students were already using hypothes.is for collaborative annotation. Holden's blog post with instructions on how to participate in the flash mob [is here](https://gamesandlearning.wordpress.com/2016/04/24/an-annotation-flash-mob-invitation/). The annotation flash mob is a fascinating example of bringing eventness to the collaborative web. Several of Holden's students and many individuals outside of the course jumped in to annotate Morris' article. One participant's comments captured the feeling of eventness, "“Love[d] getting to play in the digital annotation flashmob – I’m reminded of the frequently referenced analogy of the digital mimicking sandbox play." 
More generally, instructors are using hypothes.is in their courses for collaborative annotation, as in this [example from Brian Watkins at Austin College](http://acdigitalpedagogy.org/category/hypothes-is/).

* The Daily Create
